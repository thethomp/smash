Date: 10/24

Rules:

- Each player has a pod of 9 characters to play
- For each match, the player will pick a character from their pod to play, they cannot play that character again until they've played all other characters in their pod.
- Characters are selected in secret, you will not have knowledge of what your opponent picks when you select your character to play for your match.

Draft Rules:

- No DLC characters allowed
- There are 74 non-DLC characters. I'll be personally taking 2 out of the draft. You can have fun figuring out which ones were removed.
- The pods will be initially populated with 5 random characters, the remaining 4 characters for your pod will be drafted (round-robin)
- Randomization will be done programmatically (Python) using standard random library
